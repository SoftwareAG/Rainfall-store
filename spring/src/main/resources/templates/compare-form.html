    <p>Select two or more test runs to include in a comparative report:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a test case in the <b>Select test case</b> list.</li>
        <li>
            The runs for the selected test case will appear in the <b>Select runs to include</b> list
            in a reverse chronological order,<br>color-coded depending on status:
            <span style="color:blue">COMPLETE</span>,
            <span style="color:red">FAILED</span>,
            <span style="color:green">INCOMPLETE</span>, or
            <span style="color:gray">UNKNOWN</span>.
            <br>Baseline runs are highlighted by bold and underlined font.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select runs and press <b>Include selected runs</b> button:
            the runs will be added to the <b>Included runs</b> list.
        </li>
        <li>
            To include runs from other test cases, return to step 1.
            Note that the <b>Included runs</b> list will remain unchanged.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can edit <b>Included runs</b> list using <b>Exclude selected runs</b> or <b>Clear</b> buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <b>Common operations in all included runs</b> field always contains the set intersection
            of<br>the operations in current runs in <b>Included runs</b> list.<br>
            The field is blank when the list is empty or at list one included run has no completed operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <b>Compare common operations</b> button is active when the <b>Included runs</b> list
            contains at least one item, and<br>
            the <b>Common operations in all included runs</b> is not blank.
            Press this button to create a comparative report including<br>
            the runs and their common operations, in a new browser window.
